        "# Deep Dive Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "An Agentic RAG is required when we use reasoning to determine which action(s) to take and in which order to take them. Essentially we use agents instead of a LLM directly to accomplish a set of tasks which requires planning, multi step reasoning, tool use and/or learning over time. Agents give us agency!\n",
        "\n",
        "Agency : The ability to take action or to choose what action to take\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of RAG, we can plug in agents to enhance the reasoning prior to selection of RAG pipelines, within a RAG pipeline for retrieval or reranking and finally for synthesising before we send out the response. This improves RAG to a large extent by automating complex workflows and decisions that are required for a non trivial RAG use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of this Agentic RAG\n",
        "This notebook presents a practical implementation of Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—a system where decision-making and tool selection are delegated to an intelligent agent before executing a response. Rather than passing every query through a static RAG pipeline, this system introduces agency—the ability to choose the best course of action depending on the nature of the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the heart of this implementation is a router prompt, which classifies user queries into one of three categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "- OpenAI documentation: Queries related to tools, APIs, or usage guidelines for OpenAI models\n",
        "- 10-K financial reports: Questions requiring retrieval from company filings or financial datasets\n",
        "- Live Internet search: Broader, current, or comparative queries that need web access\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the query is classified, the system invokes a corresponding route handler:\n",
        "\n",
        "- For OpenAI and 10-K queries, it retrieves relevant context from a vector database (Qdrant) using text embeddings, then applies a RAG-based response generator.\n",
        "- For Internet queries, it fetches real-time information using a web-access API (ARES).\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is an example of Agentic RAG, where reasoning precedes retrieval and generation. By plugging in agents before and within the RAG pipeline, we make the system smarter and more adaptive. This allows us to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Automatically choose the right retrieval method based on context\n",
        "- Combine structured knowledge with real-time search\n",
        "- Scale RAG beyond trivial use cases by integrating multi-step decision logic\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, no external agentic frameworks are used—this is a ground-up implementation that demonstrates how to build a lightweight but intelligent agentic system using only a language model, prompt engineering, and retrieval tools."

            "   ```bash\n",
            "   curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions/chat_abc123/messages \\\n",

            "   ```bash\n",

            "Answer: The OpenAI Assistants API allows you to interact with virtual assistants powered by large language models, such as GPT-4. These assistants are designed to perform specific tasks based on instructions and parameters set by the user. With the Assistants API, you can create, retrieve, and modify these assistants to suit various applications, such as tutoring, information retrieval, creative writing, and more.\n",
            "\n",
            "To use the Assistants API, you provide your OpenAI API key for authorization and specify parameters like the assistant's instructions, model type, and available tools[1]. The API supports different functionalities for managing assistants:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Retrieving an Assistant**: You can retrieve details about a specific assistant using its unique ID. This ID is typically generated when the assistant is created, and it helps you reference the assistant in subsequent API calls[2].\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Creating and Modifying Assistants**: You can create new assistants with customized instructions and modify existing ones. Parameters include the assistant's name, model, instructions, and any tools the assistant can use. For example, you can create a \"Math Tutor\" assistant with code interpretation capabilities to help answer math-related questions effectively[3].\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Pagination and Filtering**: When listing assistants, the API provides options for pagination, allowing you to specify cursors (like before or after object IDs) to navigate through lists of assistants. You can also set the limit for the number of assistant objects returned and choose the sort order based on their creation timestamp[4].\n",
            "\n",
            "By leveraging the Assistants API, users can employ AI-driven assistants tailored to their specific needs, making tasks simpler and more efficient. For more details on specific API endpoints and functionality, you can refer to OpenAI's official documentation or API reference guides.\n",
